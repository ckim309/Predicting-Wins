# About the Project
The NBA (National Basketball Association) can be defined as having 2 distinguished periods during a season. The first, is the regular season which consists of 30 teams that play 82 games, and the second, a postseason tournament called the “Playoffs” to determine the league champion. Prior to the 2019 – 2020 season, teams that finished within the top 8 seeds in their respective conference, the East and the West, were advanced to the Playoffs. However, with the introduction of the “Play-Ins”, only the top 6 teams from each conference advance to the Playoffs while teams that finish the season between 7th and 10th seed compete for the final 4 spots (2 spots in the East and 2 spots in the West). 

This analysis will look at the statistics of an NBA to determine whether the Los Angeles Lakers will achieve enough wins to finish the season within the top 6 places from each conference, guaranteeing the Lakers a spot in the Playoffs. 

The purpose of this project is to create a statistical model that can be used to predict the season record for teams in the NBA. This analysis will look specifically at the Los Angeles Lakers and determine whether they will win enough games to finish the regular season within the top 6 seeds in their respective conference.


# Analysis Summary
The Los Angeles Lakers will not win enough games by the end of the 2022 - 2023 season to directly advance to the Playoffs. The team is predicted to win 44 games in the regular season, but to directly advance to the Playoffs, they need to win 49 games. Winning 49 games in the regular season requires the team to have a net rating of 4.5. However, the Lakers have a net rating of 0.6. The net rating is the difference between the offensive rating and defensive rating. Their offensive rating is worse than the league’s average, while their defensive rating is better than the league’s average. Despite ranking 2nd in the number of 2 pointers and free throws made, the Lakers are ranked 24th in the number of 3 pointers made. Also, the team is shooting at an inefficient rate, negatively affecting their offensive rating because the offensive rating is the number of points produced per 100 possessions. Therefore, the Los Angeles Lakers should look to improve their shooting percentages around all aspects of their offense and attempt more 3 pointers per game.
