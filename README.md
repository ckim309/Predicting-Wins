# About the Project
The NBA can be defined as having 2 distinguished periods throughout a season. The first, is the regular season which consists of 30 teams that play 82 games with the goal of reaching the playoffs, and the second, a postseason tournament to determine the league champion. Prior to the 2020-2021 season, teams that finished within the top 8 seeds in their respective conference, the East and the West, played in the playoffs. However, with the introduction of the play-in tournament, the top 6 teams from each conference are now guaranteed a spot in the playoffs while teams that finished the season between 7th and 10th place competed for the final 2 spots. This means that a team with a worse record may go to the playoffs. Therefore, this analysis will look at the statistics of an NBA team to determine whether a team will achieve enough wins to finish the season within the top 6 places from each conference, guaranteeing the team a spot in the playoffs. 

This analysis will look specifically at the Los Angeles Lakers.

# Analysis Summary
The Los Angeles Lakers, with a NRtg of -1.7, is predicted to win 36 games by the end of the 2022 â€“ 2023 NBA season. The team should look to change the rotation of their current roster to reach a more optimal NRtg of 5.9 or bring in key players that will have a positive impact towards increasing the NRtg in order to win a total of 54 games in the regular season to be guaranteed a spot in the Playoffs next year.


Wins = 39.83787 + 2.40815(NRtg)
